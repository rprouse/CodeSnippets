# Visual Studio Code Snippets

I am trying to drop ReSharper now that I am using Visual Studio 2015, but the one thing I miss the most is their great support for code snippets. This is a very limited start so far, but I hope to build up a library of code snippets for Visual Studio that replaces those that I had in ReSharper.

I am already finding the existing code snippet functionality limited, even in VS 2015. Maybe it is time for another Visual Studio extension?
